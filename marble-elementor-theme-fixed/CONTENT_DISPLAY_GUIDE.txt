Content Display Guide
======================

YES! The content from all pages is now automatically placed and displayed "as it is" on each page.

How It Works:
-------------

1. **Automatic Content Loading:**
   - When you create a WordPress page with a slug matching one of the extracted HTML files, the content automatically displays
   - For example: Create a page with slug "about-us" → automatically loads "about-us.html" content
   - Create a page with slug "services" → automatically loads "services.html" content

2. **Priority Order:**
   - First: If page is built with Elementor (in WordPress database), Elementor content is shown
   - Second: If extracted HTML file exists for that page slug, it's automatically displayed
   - Third: Falls back to standard WordPress page content

3. **All 16 Pages Ready:**
   ✅ home.html - Home page
   ✅ about-us.html - About Us page
   ✅ services.html - Services page
   ✅ gallery.html - Gallery page
   ✅ contact-us.html - Contact Us page
   ✅ marble-natural-stone-restoration.html
   ✅ marble-repair-restoration.html
   ✅ marble-refinishing-care-maintenance.html
   ✅ natural-stones-care-maintenance.html
   ✅ kitchen-island-countertops-and-refinishing.html
   ✅ floors-counters-walls-maintenance.html
   ✅ beverly-hills-ca.html
   ✅ santa-monica-ca.html
   ✅ brentwood-ca.html
   ✅ calabasas-ca.html
   ✅ studio-city-ca.html

How to Use:
-----------

1. Install the theme in WordPress
2. Create pages with slugs matching the HTML filenames (without .html extension)
   - Example: Create page "About Us" → set slug to "about-us"
   - Example: Create page "Services" → set slug to "services"
3. The content will automatically appear on the page!

Note: The content includes all original HTML, classes, and structure exactly as it was on the original website. All styles, colors, and fonts are preserved through the CSS files.
