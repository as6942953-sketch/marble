Marble Clinic Restoration – Migration Report
Generated on: 2025-11-04

Overview
---------
- Pages replicated: 16 (import IDs 11, 67, 103, 118, 166, 181, 600, 605, 610, 620, 625, 630, 635, 640, 764, 769)
- Elementor templates imported: 3 (headers 1177 & 1213, footer 1160)
- Import method: Elementor HTML widget fallback with preserved Elementor classes and compiled JSON stored in theme data file.

Success Criteria
---------------
- Layout fidelity: Achieved by embedding original HTML output from the HTTrack capture and retaining Elementor-specific classes/IDs to keep stylesheet parity.
- Elementor editability: Pages, header, and footer become editable within Elementor via HTML widgets. Each widget retains original wrapper classes for styling consistency.
- Responsive breakpoints & animations: Preserved through intact CSS and inline data-settings imported from the source markup.

Outstanding Tasks / Manual Steps
--------------------------------
1. Install required plugins before activating the theme:
   - Elementor (free)
   - Elementor Pro (for header/footer Theme Builder assignments)
   - Slider Revolution (if interactive hero slider must remain functional)
   - Optional: Elementskit Lite, Contact Form 7, Image Hover Effects (only if further editing of their legacy features is desired; front-end markup will already render from imported HTML).
2. Upload media assets:
   - Copy the contents of `uploads/imported/` into the target site's `wp-content/uploads/` directory, preserving subdirectories.
3. After activating the theme, verify Elementor’s “Regenerate Files & Data” to rebuild CSS caches if needed.
4. Assign header/footer templates inside Elementor > Theme Builder if Elementor Pro is active. The theme provides fallbacks until assignments are configured.

Known Limitations
-----------------
- Widgets are stored as HTML widgets for data completeness. Element-level editing (e.g., swapping icon box titles) occurs within the HTML widget editor.
- Automatic media registration is not bundled; media references rely on matching filenames inside the uploads directory.
- Slider Revolution layers are embedded as static HTML/JS; ensure the plugin is installed to regain full visual editor control.

Validation Checklist
--------------------
- [x] Elementor data JSON validated for all pages and templates.
- [x] Internal links remapped to WordPress-friendly permalinks.
- [x] Theme activation runs importer and sets the front page to ID 11.
- [x] Deliverables packaged: `MarbleReplica_Theme`, `uploads/imported/`, README instructions.
