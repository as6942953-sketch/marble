Marble Replica Migration Report
Date: 2025-11-04

Overview
--------
The Elementor blueprint was extracted from the HTTrack archive and converted into a WordPress theme importer. Activation of the `MarbleReplica_Theme` theme seeds pages, templates, and menus. Media and Elementor CSS are provided under `uploads/imported/`.

Imported Content
----------------
- Pages created: 16
  - home
  - services
  - marble-natural-stone-restoration
  - gallery
  - contact-us
  - marble-repair-restoration
  - marble-refinishing-care-maintenance
  - natural-stones-care-maintenance
  - beverly-hills-ca
  - santa-monica-ca
  - brentwood-ca
  - calabasas-ca
  - studio-city-ca
  - about-us
  - kitchen-island-countertops-and-refinishing
  - floors-counters-walls-maintenance

- Elementor templates: 2
  - Header (`marble-replica-header`)
  - Footer (`marble-replica-footer`)

- Navigation menus generated from header markup:
  - `menu-main-menu-1` → assigned to `primary`
  - `menu-main-menu` → assigned to `secondary`
  - `menu-new-menu` → assigned to `mobile`
  (Menus are rendered through the `[marble_menu]` shortcode.)

Assets & Styles
---------------
- Uploads directory: `wp-content/uploads/imported/`
  - Images, icons, fonts, Elementor per-page CSS, and global assets reside here.
- Elementor CSS files loaded by theme:
  post-103.css, post-11.css, post-1160.css, post-1177.css, post-118.css, post-166.css,
  post-181.css, post-600.css, post-605.css, post-610.css, post-620.css, post-625.css,
  post-630.css, post-635.css, post-640.css, post-67.css, post-764.css, post-769.css, post-8.css

Manual Follow-up
----------------
- Install and activate Elementor, Elementor Pro, and Contact Form 7 before theme activation.
- Slider Revolution markup is preserved; install Slider Revolution if animated behaviour is desired.
- Confirm media path `wp-content/uploads/imported/` exists before visiting the site. Missing files will break background images.
- After activation, flush Elementor CSS (Elementor ▸ Tools ▸ Regenerate CSS) if styles appear outdated.

Validation Notes
----------------
- All internal links were converted to slug-based placeholders and resolve to WordPress permalinks at import time.
- Menus were regenerated from the captured HTML; editing them in **Appearance ▸ Menus** updates the header automatically.
- No missing media detected in the extracted HTTrack archive.
